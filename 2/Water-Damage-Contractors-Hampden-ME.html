<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely damaging. Jake and his men were incredible in helping us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to your house and started drying our drenched crawlspace right away. They returned every day (frequently two times a day) to keep track of and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and also were very useful in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>
