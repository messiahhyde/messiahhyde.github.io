<p>Step 5: Restoration - The biggest action in the process is restoration. Restoration includes replacing products like drywall and insulation.

Part of our tracking process consists of inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying task back days.
