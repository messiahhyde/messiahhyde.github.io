<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Step the height and width of the space you're fixing so that you know how much new wallboard you require. If you need custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, utilize your measurements to cut a spot to fit, using an energy knife or drywall saw. Align your brand-new panel with the wall studs and then protect the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power chauffeur. Use joint tape to cover the seams where each panel fulfills. Then use joint substance over the tape, using a putty knife.

Anything bigger should be connected to the ceiling joists in order to securely hold the patch's weight as well as any insulation above it.</p>
