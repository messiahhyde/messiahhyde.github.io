<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As mentioned, fast air movement throughout damp surfaces of assemblies or products is an important part of successfully and effectively drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface vary from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or materials. Quick air motion throughout the surface area of product ends up being lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of getting rid of surface wetness gives way to lowering moisture content in low evaporation materials. The consistent and falling rates of drying products require various criteria for changing conditions.</p>
