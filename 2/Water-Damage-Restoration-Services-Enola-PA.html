<p>Flooding of a private sewer system can be a harmful scenario for homeowners, according to Plumbing 2.0's seasoned plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It might lead to a back-up of sewage in the home, contaminated drinking water and lack of sanitation up until the system is fixed. When flooding or saturated soil conditions persist, a private sewer system can not operate effectively (common plumbing issues in old homes ).
