<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Class 4 - deeply held or bound water. Water invasion that includes a significant quantity of water absorption into low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floors, or other complex, built up assemblies). Drying might need special techniques, longer drying times, or substantial water vapor pressure differentials.</p>
