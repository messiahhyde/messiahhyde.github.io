<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As pointed out, rapid air movement throughout damp surfaces of assemblies or materials is a crucial component of successfully and effectively drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess wetness within the materials or assemblies. Fast air motion throughout the surface area of product becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of getting rid of surface area wetness gives way to minimizing moisture material in low evaporation materials. The constant and falling rates of drying materials require different criteria for changing conditions.</p>
