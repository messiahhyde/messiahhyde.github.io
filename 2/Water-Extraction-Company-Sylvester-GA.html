<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and carried away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has come out each day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to do the job correctly.
