<p>The biggest component that can be gotten rid of is the moisture that mold requires to cultivate. There are over 100,000 types of types of mold, but the most common kinds of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore lands on a food source that is warm and wet, it begins to sprout and colonize within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots start to grow into the food source and mycotoxins or harmful gasses are launched as the fungi spreads. Mold in your home can be incredibly dangerous and cause a range of health issues. If the mold in your home is not removed appropriately it can continue to grow, making reliable mold remediation more difficult and pricey.<p>
