<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens. An automatic shut-off valve is excellent insurance coverage to have in any situation, particularly when the water heater system is located inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your water heater looms unless fixed rapidly, and the expenses go up the longer the issue goes uncorrected. The perpetrator may have been something as easy as a pressure relief valve requiring changing or something devastating like a tank failure.</p>
<p>If you have a mold issue, a mold assessment is the first step in the process of identifying. Throughout a mold evaluation, AdvantaClean's licensed mold professionals, will check, sample and test the air in and around your home for mold detection.
