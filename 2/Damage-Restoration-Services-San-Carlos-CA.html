Any significant sagging in parts of the walls or ceiling is a sign that you need water damage repair services. Drywall 1 sags when filled with water. Seeing visible mold on the walls is another sign, but not everyone notices mold within their homes. Prior to mold is located, you may smell an unique musty fragrance or experience allergy signs due to mold direct exposure. These odors are particularly pungent in areas like the basement.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>
