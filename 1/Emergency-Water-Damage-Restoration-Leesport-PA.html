<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
