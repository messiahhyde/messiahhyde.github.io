Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed instead of being fully replaced. If there is small damage then most of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard may require fixing. However, if the damage is major then the whole floor might need replacing and often even the subfloor also. The kind of wood floor covering you may have limits the type and figures out of repairs that need to take place. Solid hardwood floor covering allows for a wider range of options to repair the problem. With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface.

In the event where drywall does get wet and simply starts to sag before drying, fixing it may simply need pushing it back into place, protecting it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
