<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air till they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same way, so if the location the spores land is good and damp, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surface areas begins next. Antimicrobial and antifungal cleansers are used on any tough surface areas to eliminate the mold from the surface area. If anything can be removed, such as furniture, clothes, or toys, these are generally brought offsite for cleaning to make certain all mold spores are eliminated, normally involving deep cleaning with an antimicrobial or antifungal cleanser.</p>
