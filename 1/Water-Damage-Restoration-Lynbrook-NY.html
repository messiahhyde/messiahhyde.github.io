<p>Mold can trigger severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

<p>A/C: Heating unit and a/c systems can become flooded, which can damage their internal electrical systems and splash pilot lights. They can also end up being muddy, and cleaning them will need expert cleaning. In addition, venting systems can flood and become polluted. They must be taken apart and hosed off piece by piece to prevent contamination from being blown through the air if that happens.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to resolve using bleach on mold. Utilizing bleach on noticeable mold development is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Standard for Expert Mold Remediation. First, bleach is a chemical and can impact people with chemical level of sensitivities especially if used in locations that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more reliable at removing mold than a mild detergent and a moist cloth, so we recommend the least harmful option.</p>
