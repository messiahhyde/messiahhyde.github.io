Fabrics may be cleaned, for instance, but anything the mold and wetness may have permanently blemished or damaged, such as drywall 3, insulation, or carpets may need to be removed. Costs start at $2,000 for cleaning materials, but can reach $10,000 for getting rid of and changing drywall 3 and carpets.</p>
<p>Getting it damp can turn into a major headache since the gypsum drywall is soluble and permeable in water. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the event where drywall does get wet and simply begins to sag prior to drying out, repairing it might just need pressing it back into location, protecting it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
