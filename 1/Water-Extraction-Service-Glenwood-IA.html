<h3>Smoke Damage Restoration in Glenwood</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, plaster and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. It can be a permanent health threat and need to be gotten rid of if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the tip of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
<p>Home Leak Detection System is the option ... A whole home leakage detection system with automatic water shutoffs identify when water is running continually for an extended time period and will immediately shutoff your water, really cool, so check it out.
