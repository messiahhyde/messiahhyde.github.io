<p>Water invasion into buildings can be incredibly destructive. Jake and his guys were amazing in helping us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to your home and began drying out our soaked crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (frequently two times a day) to monitor and change the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and also were extremely helpful in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd advise them without doubt.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was easy: It was a best storm"-- a mix that lawyers now allege came from pressure to build faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure materials, and little federal government and home builder oversight. Contribute to that a climate like Pennsylvania's, where the average annual rains is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much higher.</p>
