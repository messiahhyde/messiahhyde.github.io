<p>If smoke and fire damage has actually affected your belongings, we will deal with you and your insurer to determine what can be restored, and what will be an insurance replacement claim. For items that can be restored, we utilize ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged personal belongings. For this, we utilized Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is imitate a glue which penetrates into permeable surface, preventing water from leaking back through. Basically, it makes the area solid once again and secures the surface area from future water damage. After you have applied the Peel-Stop, allow for an hour of drying time.<p>
<p>Mold Containment. The source of the wetness problem is addressed and the affected area is closed off to avoid infecting the rest of your home with mold spores stimulated throughout the removal process. The undamaged items that are safe from original flood damage can get messed up due to the fact that it is taking in moisture from the air if the internal humidity of the structure isn't managed. The structures that are not dried properly or fast enough will function as food sources for mold. This will later on lead to a more expensive mold removal services.<p>
<p>Get rid of the source of water, if possible, or contact suitable parties to get rid of the water source or to make necessary repair work.
