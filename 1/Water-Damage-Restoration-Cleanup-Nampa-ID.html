<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was leaking. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and carried away everything else.  We were really happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to do the job appropriately.
