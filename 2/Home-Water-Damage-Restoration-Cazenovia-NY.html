<p>When a client calls with a water damage emergency, our group is prepared to react instantly. Immediate water extraction and drying is required to consist of the extent of the water damage and not run the risk of additional damage.

<p>Deterioration is a process, which converts refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the gradual and slow deterioration of products (normally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration takes place when you combine electricity, metal, oxygen and water, creating iron oxide (or what is more commonly referred to as rust). There is no reliable schedule for this process to happen; a MacBook's internal elements generally start corroding immediately after the spill, however sometimes your Mac can operate generally for days or weeks without showing any apparent sign of an issue. How quick the corrosion process takes depends on a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and the length of time the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can attend to the damage. Below are a few examples of deterioration brought on by a water spill.</p>
