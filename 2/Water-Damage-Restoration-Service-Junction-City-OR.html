<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have actually ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
