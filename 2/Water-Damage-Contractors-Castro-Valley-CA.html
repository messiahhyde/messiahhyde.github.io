<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Often it will be obvious that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might reveal noticeable indications of wetness, leaking water, or indications of stopping working structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels may fall apart or sag under the weight of water that fills the naturally porous plaster material. Other times, you may discover small signs like coffee-colored discolorations that might expand over time.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>

<p>When standing water is removed, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) remove the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure consists of examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any changes.</p>
