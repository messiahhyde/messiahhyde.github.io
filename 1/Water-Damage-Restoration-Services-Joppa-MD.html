<p>The Epa (EPA) advises discarding products that have not been completely cleaned and dried within 2 days of water damage. Fix any leaks or underlying problems right now to help avoid mold growth or its return. Mold exists naturally in the air inside and beyond your home.

<p>The purpose of water mitigation is to avoid more damage in a water damage scenario. Service contractors remove affected structures, like drywall and flooring.
