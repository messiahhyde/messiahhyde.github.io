<p>Removing among the three requirements for mold minimizes (or eliminates) new mold development: wetness; food for the mold spores (for instance, dust or dander ); and heat because mold normally does not grow in cold environments. I had an excellent experience dealing with the group at Northwest Water and Fire Restoration. They were expert, punctual and extremely communicative! I would absolutely recommend for any mitigation or restoration work you require.<p>
<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and carried away whatever else.  We were really delighted that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next service day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got a lot carried out in one day!  Someone has come out every day to sign in and I feel great in their understanding and capabilities to get the job done effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
