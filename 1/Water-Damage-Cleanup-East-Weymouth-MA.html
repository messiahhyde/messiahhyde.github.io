<p>We can prevent additional damage. Flooding can spawn extra issues like structural damage and the growth of mold and mildew.

<p>Keep in mind: While many experts suggest a relative humidity of less than 60%, below 50% is best for managing both mold growth and dust mites. Dust mites are tiny animals associated with spiders, ticks and other termites. Allergen eat mold and dead human or animal skin scales (flakes) and leave allergenic proteins. Dust mites reduce irritant production at these lower humidity levels. Stop toilet texting - Searching sessions and texting rallies always seem more immediate than they actually are.
