If you need custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, utilize your measurements to cut a patch to fit, using an energy knife or drywall saw. Align your new panel with the wall studs and then secure the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power chauffeur. Use joint tape to cover the joints where each panel meets.

Let the substance dry for the time defined by the producer and then sand the substance with fine-grit sandpaper up until the seams are flush with the drywall panels.</p>
