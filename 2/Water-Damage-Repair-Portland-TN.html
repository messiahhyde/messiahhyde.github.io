When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to get the job done appropriately.
