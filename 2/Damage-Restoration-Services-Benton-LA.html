<h2>The Benefits of Using an Independent Restoration Company in Benton</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have actually ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>
