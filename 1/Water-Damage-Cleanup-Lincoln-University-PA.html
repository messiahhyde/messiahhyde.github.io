<p>Mold can start to grow within 24 to 2 days after water damage is done to a property. Once the mold is present, spores can then begin to spread out throughout your home. That's why it is imperative you look for instant assistance to clean up any water damage. While the majority of water-related catastrophes can not be anticipated there are some preventative actions you can take to avoid future water damage.<p>

<p>Mold requires nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperature levels to grow. Nutrients for mold exist in dead organic product such as wood, paper or materials; mold can likewise obtain nutrients from some synthetic items such as paints and adhesives. Mold needs moisture, although some mold species can acquire that moisture from wet air when the relative humidity is above 70 per cent. Thoroughly pry baseboards far from walls so that you can inspect sheetrock at floor level. The porous product can rapidly take in flood water, and you need to understand the extent of possible damage.<p>
