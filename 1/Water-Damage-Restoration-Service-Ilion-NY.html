<p>When you are planning large repairs, remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By decreasing the thickness here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is essential to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges.

This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is completed.<p>
