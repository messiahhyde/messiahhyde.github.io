<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Oshkosh</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a permanent health risk and should be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
