<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Scottsboro</h3>
<p>Inspect the drywall to see just how much damage has actually been done. Heavily water-infiltrated wallboard will droop from ceilings or collapse to the touch. Eliminate all jeopardized drywall by hand or use the claw end of a hammer or a trashing bar to eliminate it. If drywall panels just reveal water spots but aren't structurally compromised, they may be repairable by eliminating the damaged portion. When eliminating around the damaged area, utilize a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangle-shaped shape. You can then make a spot with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
