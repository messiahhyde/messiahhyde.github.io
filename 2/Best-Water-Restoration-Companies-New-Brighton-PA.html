<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is a harsh, corrosive chemical. Chlorine bleach also gives off extreme fumes and it even produces harmful gas when combined with ammonia.

For these reasons attempt to avoid utilizing bleach and if you must utilize it, only use it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
