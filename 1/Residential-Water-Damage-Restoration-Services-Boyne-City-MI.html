Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements.

While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>
