<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be exceptionally devastating. Jake and his men were remarkable in helping us get through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (typically two times a day) to keep track of and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the way and also were very handy in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>

<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Woodland Hills</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be an irreversible health hazard and must be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
