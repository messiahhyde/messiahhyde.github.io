Let it sit for five minutes, and after that clean it away with a wet towel. Just like some of the above techniques, you can utilize a toothbrush to scrub at the problem zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough. For ideal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little additional heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
