<h3>House Water Damage in Santa Rosa California</h2>
<p>When you're removing the damaged area, it's a good idea to cut it out as a rectangle or square While this typically increases the amount of area you need to change, this makes it much easier to cut and fit patches. It also makes the mudding and taping work simpler to blend in with the remainder of the location. For ceilings, spots that are 12 square inches or less can be kept in place with drywall clips. Anything larger should be attached to the ceiling joists in order to safely hold the patch's weight along with any insulation above it.</p>

If the mold is considered to have actually come from water damage, some insurance companies might make you submit a second claim of water damage instead, needing you to pay another deductible before remediation happens.</p>
