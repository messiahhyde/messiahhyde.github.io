<p>Since typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or wetness exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
