<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the home with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one unit for every 2 to 3 spaces, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it goes through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which means that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This procedure goes on for days.
