<p>Since common building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or moisture exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
