<p>Rust is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the slow and steady degeneration of materials (normally metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration takes place when you combine electrical power, oxygen, water and metal, producing iron oxide (or what is more commonly known as rust). There is no reliable schedule for this process to occur; a MacBook's internal elements generally start rusting instantly after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can operate generally for days or weeks without showing any apparent sign of an issue. How fast the deterioration procedure takes depends upon a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and for how long the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all till you can deal with the damage. Below are a few examples of deterioration caused by a water spill.</p>
