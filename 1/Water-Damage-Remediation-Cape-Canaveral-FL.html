<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to evaluate which drying devices or approaches will be the most reliable. It is vital to determine if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based upon the outdoors temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can help in identifying what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, sensible and latent energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly anticipates the energy evaluation of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure materials and how they react to each one and supply the best evaporation results. The higher the number, the faster products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more practical if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
