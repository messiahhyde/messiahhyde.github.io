<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Water damage, water invasion, developing envelope issues, and building problems are a really serious matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding areas are experiencing countless problems due to leaking windows and doors, water and wind driven rain damage. Senior living facilities, homes, condominiums, townhomes, hotels, industrial structures are particularly susceptible to these issues as usually the home builder subcontracts the outside envelope work and wall assembly process, for that reason leading to corners and expenses being cut.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the plaster drywall is porous and soluble in water, getting it damp can become a major headache. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place.
