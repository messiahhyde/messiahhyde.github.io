<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health danger and ought to be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
