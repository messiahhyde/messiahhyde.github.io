<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air up until they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same method, so if the place the spores land is wet and great, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
