Once this flammable fuel - drywall, carpet, or furnishings - has been heated up to its unique ignition temperature level, the fuel will catch fire and unpredictable gases will be launched in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can cause lasting damage and should be handled by experienced specialists, heat is the most noticeable, and harmful, product of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - suggesting that as a fire enters into contact with extra fuel, the response continues and the fire spreads.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for every 2 to 3 rooms, depending on the size of the space. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it travels through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and certified to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which indicates that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the smell got rid of. This process goes on for days.
