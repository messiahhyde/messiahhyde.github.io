<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier since it is self-adhesive, lots of expert drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't constantly hassle-free. Using paper tape requires some practice and little skill, but it's well worth finding out. As soon as the meters read wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the service technician will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this moment, the water remediation procedure is thought about to finish.<p>
