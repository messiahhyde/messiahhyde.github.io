This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with a really expensive paperweight if this deterioration process is not stopped.</p>
