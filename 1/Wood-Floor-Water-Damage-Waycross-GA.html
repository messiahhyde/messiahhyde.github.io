<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is actually made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this indicates that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve searching a wide location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
