Did you understand that smoke is in fact made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Many people think that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion happens, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this means that the smoke will spread, harming a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include browsing a wide location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
