It can be an irreversible health risk and should be gotten rid of if soaked by contaminated floodwater.

This develops a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the idea of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
