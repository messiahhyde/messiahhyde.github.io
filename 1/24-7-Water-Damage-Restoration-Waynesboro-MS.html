<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air up until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the very same way, so if the place the spores land is wet and excellent, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Since typical building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is generally related to water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
