<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Not to complicate the matter, however to include some clarity to the concern of mold, mold spores threaten. They threaten whether dead or alive. So mold removal is different than mold cleaning. Oftentimes, mold spores can be eliminated quite quickly from surfaces. But a stain can remain. An all-inclusive mold remediation and stain removal should be carried out to guarantee a safe, indoor air environment.</p>
