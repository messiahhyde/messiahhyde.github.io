<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inadequate against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
