<p>Find out how to eliminate black mold safely and effectively. Burst or broken pipes can be a significant headache when you have water damage and aren't sure immediately from where the source of damage is coming from.

<p>Due to the fact that common building materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
