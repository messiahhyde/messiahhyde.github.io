<p>Find out how to eliminate black mold safely and effectively. Burst or broken pipes can be a significant headache when you have water damage and aren't sure immediately from where the source of damage is coming from.

Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
