<h3>Facts About House Fire Damage You Need To Be Aware Of in Maplewood</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repairs. By lowering the density here, it's much easier to conceal long taped seams under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is essential to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs.
