<p>Due to the fact that common building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally related to water or moisture exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
