<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly harmful. We engaged a group of researchers at the University of Colorado as soon as InstaScope was created. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a worldwide recognized specialist on the biological elements of air contamination, this group was assigned to validate and check the brand-new technology. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we had the ability to create a new mold-assessment system for business consumers that, unlike any other approach or gadget, can deliver scientifically precise, area-by-area results-- and do so quickly. So when you think about all the dangers of mold, InstaScope is a vital tool to help make sure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>
