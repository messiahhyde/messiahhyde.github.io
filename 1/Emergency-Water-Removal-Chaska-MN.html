<h3>Affordable Fire Restoration Companies in Chaska</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning big repairs. By minimizing the thickness here, it's easier to conceal long taped joints under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is essential to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is completed, this helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
