Enthalpy and its subcomponents, sensible and hidden energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately anticipates the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure materials and how they react to each one and supply the best evaporation outcomes. The higher the number, the faster materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more useful if the outdoors grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
