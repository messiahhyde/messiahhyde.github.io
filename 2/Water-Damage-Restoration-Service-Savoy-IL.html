<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your home or company is one of the most disastrous things that can happen to a family or an individual. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed rather than being fully replaced. Then the bulk of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard might require fixing, if there is minor damage. However, if the damage is significant then the whole floor may require replacing and in some cases even the subfloor too. The sort of wood flooring you might have determines and restricts the type of repairs that need to happen. Strong hardwood floor covering enables a wider variety of alternatives to repair the problem. With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface. This type of floor covering can also have replacements for specific planks. The best way to take care of a water damaged location on your wood floor is to replace the affected boards and after that refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
