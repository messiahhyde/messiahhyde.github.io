Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air until they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the exact same method, so if the place the spores land is moist and excellent, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
