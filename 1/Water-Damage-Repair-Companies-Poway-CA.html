<p>Next use the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to clean the soot and smoke spots. This phase is vital, as these sponges utilize unique chemicals to lift stains from walls. Never utilize soot cleaner or water before you utilize a dry-cleaning sponge, or you might spread out the soot and make it impossible to remove with a chemical sponge. Start cleaning the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a various side so you're always using a clean surface. When all sides are stained, slice off the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surface areas underneath. Or merely get a new sponge. Make certain you use a cleaning motion the entire time. You may spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface area if you scrub the discolorations.</p>
