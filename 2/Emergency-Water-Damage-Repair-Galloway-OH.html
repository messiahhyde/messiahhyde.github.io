<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your home or company is among the most disastrous things that can happen to a household or a person. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed rather than being completely replaced. Then the majority of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard may require repairing, if there is small damage. However, if the damage is significant then the entire floor might need changing and sometimes even the subfloor as well. The kind of wood floor covering you might have limits the type and identifies of repairs that require to happen. Strong hardwood floor covering permits a broader range of options to fix the issue. With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface. This kind of floor covering can also have replacements for individual slabs. The best way to take care of a water damaged location on your wood floor is to replace the affected boards and after that refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
