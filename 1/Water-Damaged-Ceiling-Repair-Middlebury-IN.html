<h3>Fire and Smoke Damage Restoration in Middlebury</h3>
<p>When you are preparing large repairs, keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By minimizing the density here, it's much easier to hide long taped seams under numerous coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is essential to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is finished, this assists reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
