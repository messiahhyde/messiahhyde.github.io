<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does. Lots of people believe that due to the fact that smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much larger area than the fire itself.

The very best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve searching a large area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
