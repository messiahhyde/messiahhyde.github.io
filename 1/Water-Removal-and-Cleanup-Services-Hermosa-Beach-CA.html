The most common areas in your house for mold growth are basements, showers, around heating and cooling devices, carpets, crawlspaces and ducts. The very best way to avoid mold development is to eliminate water leaks or moisture in your house. See our short article, How Do I Prevent Mold Development?" for mold prevention suggestions.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was simple: It was a best storm"-- a combination that attorneys now declare came from pressure to construct faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure products, and little government and home builder oversight. Add to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the typical yearly rains is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much greater.</p>
