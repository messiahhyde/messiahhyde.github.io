Begin cleaning the walls carefully with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a various side so you're always utilizing a clean surface. When all sides are soiled, slice off the sides with a knife to expose fresh surfaces below. Or just get a brand-new sponge. Make certain you use a wiping motion the entire time. You may spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface area if you scrub the stains.</p>
