<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Search for visible mold growth (it may look cottony, creamy, rough, or tough and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper).

For these reasons try to avoid using bleach and if you need to use it, just utilize it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
