<p>As mentioned, in some cases ceilings, walls, or flooring have to be torn out, baseboards may be removed, or holes might be drilled into walls to make sure appropriate drying. The water restoration company may do these repair work themselves or they may subcontract the work to professionals they utilize for this kind of task. They may also advise contractors for the homeowner to get in touch with. If they so pick, owners might also be able to utilize their own contractors. When this phase is finally reached, having this discussion throughout the inspection phase of the process will let the homeowner or company owner understand what to anticipate.</p>

These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it passes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which means that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor eliminated. This process goes on for days.
