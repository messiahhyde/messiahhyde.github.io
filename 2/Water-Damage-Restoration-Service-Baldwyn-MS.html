<h3>Fire Damage Clean Up in Baldwyn</h3>
<p>If your home has mold you need to make sure it is it looked after as quickly as you can.  Mold can spread out truly rapidly, and it is more than just black areas. As it grows, it can break down the "food" that supports it, which can be the wood studs supporting your walls, the sheetrock itself, or any other organic, porous materials in your home. That can be bad news for your home, not to mention for your health.<p>
<p>Also, because bleach is mainly water, on permeable surfaces, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is easily taken in by the product. So, while you may have rubbed out or discolored the surface area mold to the point that you can't see it, you've in fact supplied a lot of water to grow back and possibly spread out the mold below the surface area. If there is a great deal of mold development, speak with the U.S. Epa's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ".  variations of these and other guidance documents are available on the EPA's Publications on Mold webpage If the musty material is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet cushioning and insulation, then removal and replacement may be necessary.<p>
