<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. An automated shut-off valve is excellent insurance to have in any circumstance, especially when the hot water heater system is located inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your hot water heater impends unless fixed quickly, and the expenses increase the longer the issue goes uncorrected. The culprit might have been something as easy as a pressure relief valve needing changing or something disastrous like a tank failure.</p>
<p>An insurance coverage may or might not cover the costs associated with water damage and the process of water damage restoration. While a typical reason for residential water damage is often the failure of a sump pump, lots of homeowner's insurance plan do not cover the associated expenses without an addendum which adds to the monthly premium of the policy. Frequently the terminology of this addendum resembles "Sewer and Drain Protection".</p>
