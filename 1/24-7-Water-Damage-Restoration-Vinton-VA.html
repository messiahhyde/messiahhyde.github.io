<p>Due to the fact that common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or wetness direct exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
