<p>Deterioration is a process, which converts refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the slow and steady wear and tear of products (usually metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion happens when you integrate electricity, metal, water and oxygen, developing iron oxide (or what is more frequently referred to as rust). There is no reputable schedule for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal parts normally begin corroding immediately after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can work normally for days or weeks without showing any obvious indication of a problem. How quickly the corrosion procedure takes depends upon a ton of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and for how long the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid.
