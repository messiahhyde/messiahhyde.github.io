Did you know that smoke is in fact made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this indicates that the smoke will spread out, harming a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve searching a large location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
