<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken.

<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was easy: It was an ideal storm"-- a mix that attorneys now allege originated from pressure to develop quicker, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building materials, and little government and contractor oversight. Add to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the typical yearly rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much higher.</p>
