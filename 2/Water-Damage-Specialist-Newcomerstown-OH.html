<h3>Fire Damage Claims in Newcomerstown - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a permanent health threat and must be eliminated.

This creates a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
