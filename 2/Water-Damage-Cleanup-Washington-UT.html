<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Over time, roofing systems might establish dark streaks. It might be dirt that can be merely power-washed off, or it might be mold.

<p>Because common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
