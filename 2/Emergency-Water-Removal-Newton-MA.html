<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's going at the current rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he discovered just how much water costs I was paying since the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the location of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really polite individual.</p>
