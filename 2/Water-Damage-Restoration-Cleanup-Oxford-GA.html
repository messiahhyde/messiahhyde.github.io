<p>Cleanup: During the cleaning and restoration phase of the project, your qualified cleanup group will utilize the suitable combination of cleaning representatives, air cleaning devices, and deodorizers. The use of chem-sponges is imperative in this phase. When it comes into contact with them, a chem-sponge collects soot and particles. It also prevents streaking on walls and surfaces. Walls and ceilings that need to be cleaned up are first cleaned with a dry chem-sponge, then with a degreaser and deodorizing representative. These several steps are required to make sure ceilings and walls are clean and that residual odor has actually been removed.</p>
