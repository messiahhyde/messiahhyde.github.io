<p>It holds true that a growing number of handset makers have moved towards waterproof designs in the last few years, and this pattern appears to have no decrease in sight. Still, not all of us have the high-end of a waterproof phone which means we need to turn to other approaches.

After the issue has been corrected, the home then needs to be completely dried, eliminating all traces of moisture.</p>
<p>The Inquirer found that in most cases, wetness may have trickled in from the first day. Beneath apparently unblemished exteriors made from different materials-- brick, stucco, vinyl siding, stone, fiber cement board, and more-- water has damaged everything from window sills to insulation that when puffed like pink cotton candy. In some cases, wooden sheathing is so saturated that it now flakes quickly, falling apart into mulch-like chips. Mold, termites, and phorid flies have plagued some walls.</p>
<p>More involved testing may involve sending samples to a testing facility, or taking samples of the air to test if there is no visible mold, however mold is suspected. Checking for mold might cost as little as $20 for a home kit or as much as $500 for expert screening. Bear in mind, though, that it is frequently baseless, as most remediation services will proceed the very same way despite what kind of mold is discovered in your home.</p>
