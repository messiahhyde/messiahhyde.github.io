<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repairs. By decreasing the thickness here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it's important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is finished, this assists strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
