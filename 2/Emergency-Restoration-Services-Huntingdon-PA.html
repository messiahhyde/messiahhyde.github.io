<h3>Smoke Damage Restoration in Huntingdon</h3>
<p>Eliminate plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge.

A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
<p>If you have actually found mold, or are concerned that a slow leak might have enabled it to grow behind a wall or other unseen area, we discover the mold, treat it, and do a total water damage remediation. We put the greatest worth on open interaction and customer service and record the entire mold removal process.
