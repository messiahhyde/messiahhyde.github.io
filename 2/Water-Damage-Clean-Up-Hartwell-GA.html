<p>Corrosion is a process, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the sluggish and gradual degeneration of materials (generally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration happens when you integrate electrical power, metal, oxygen and water, producing iron oxide (or what is more typically known as rust). There is no reliable timetable for this procedure to happen; a MacBook's internal elements typically start wearing away immediately after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can work typically for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of a problem.

The best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all until you can resolve the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust brought on by a water spill.</p>
