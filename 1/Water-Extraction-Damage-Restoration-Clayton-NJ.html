<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too.

As soon as the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the specialist will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this moment, the water remediation procedure is thought about to finish.<p>
