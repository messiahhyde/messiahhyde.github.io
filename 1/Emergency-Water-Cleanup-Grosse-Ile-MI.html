<p>Whether it takes place in your ceiling because of a leaky roofing system, condensation from your central air, or flooding, fixing water-damaged drywall can cause you anxiety and stress, specifically if you've never ever done it in the past. Mold needs just 3 things to make it through and grow: darkness, humidity and wetness. The most common locations in your home for mold development are basements, showers, around heating and cooling appliances, carpets, ducts and crawlspaces. The best way to prevent mold growth is to eliminate water leakages or moisture in your house. See our article, How Do I Avoid Mold Development?" for mold prevention pointers.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have actually ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>

<p>As moisture is released in the air, nature always attempts to reach stability. Computing the dew point is necessary in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surfaces. The humidity constantly takes place at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature the air requires to be cooled to, at constant pressure, in order to achieve an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas form. If the air were to be cooled even more, water vapor would need to come out of the environment in a liquid form. The higher the dew point rises, the higher the quantity of moisture in the air.</p>
