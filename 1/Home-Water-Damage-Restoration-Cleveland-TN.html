<p>Technicians begin water extraction utilizing effective, truck-mounted devices. All impacted locations are decontaminated if sewage is present. Specialized drying equipment, such as dehumidifiers and air movers, are utilized to speed the procedure.

Printable variations of these and other guidance documents are available on the EPA's Publications on Mold website If the moldy product is not quickly cleanable, such as drywall, carpet cushioning and insulation, then removal and replacement might be required.<p>
