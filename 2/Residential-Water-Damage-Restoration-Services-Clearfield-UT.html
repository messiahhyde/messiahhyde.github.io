<p>The biggest aspect that can be eliminated is the wetness that mold requires to cultivate. There are over 100,000 kinds of types of mold, but the most typical kinds of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore arrive on a food source that is wet and warm, it starts to colonize and germinate within 24-48 hours.
