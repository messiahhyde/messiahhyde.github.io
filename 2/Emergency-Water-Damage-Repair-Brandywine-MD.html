<h3>Water Damage Repair Companies in Brandywine Maryland</h2>
<p>Mold in the basement can be relentless, provided the nature of basements - they tend to be much more humid than above-ground levels and normally have poor ventilation and little air circulation, a mix that can cause mold to grow. And obviously, basements can be susceptible to flooding, due to extreme weather or unnoticed leaks in the pipes or sump pump. In addition, when mold establishes, concrete block or concrete walls can be difficult to clean due to their rough texture.</p>

<p>BRAVO - task well done! Found a flood at home in San Francisco - water had actually been over streaming a second floor sink for 15 hours. Contacted Allied, signed work order on line and employees were at the house within 15 minutes. They brought a truck load of devices to mitigate the damage. Drying fans were installed, heating pads were placed on hardwood floors, walls and ceilings were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes set up. Excellent, expert care. Really pleased with their speedy delivery of emergency service AND their attention to information to ensure the water damage was dried completely.</p>
