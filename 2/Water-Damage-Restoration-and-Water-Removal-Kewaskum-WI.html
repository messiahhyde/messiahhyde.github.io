<p>An insurance plan may or may not cover the expenses associated with water damage and the process of water damage restoration. While a typical cause of residential water damage is frequently the failure of a sump pump, numerous house owner's insurance coverage do not cover the associated costs without an addendum which adds to the month-to-month premium of the policy. Often the terminology of this addendum is similar to "Sewer and Drain Pipes Coverage".</p>
