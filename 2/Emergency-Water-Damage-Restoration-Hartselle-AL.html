<h3>Water Damaged Hardwood Floor in Hartselle Alabama</h2>
<p>When a client calls with a water damage emergency, our team is prepared to react right away. Immediate water extraction and drying is required to include the extent of the water damage and not run the risk of more damage. Mold becomes a significant threat if water sits too long. The longer a water damage situation is left unsolved, the more damage occurs and the problem will end up being more expensive to repair.</p>
<p>Because mold and mildew can be a major health danger, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove up to 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be gotten rid of to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with full sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product ought to be removed to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>This area of the attic is among the most regularly affected spaces, which is why it's often treated independently. Leakages from the roofing will make this location damp, which in turn leads 2 to greater than average mold growth. Cleaning the underside of the deck thoroughly and utilizing scrubbers to make sure the spores don't spread is the common process here, and costs around $500.</p>
