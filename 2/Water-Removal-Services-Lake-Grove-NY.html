Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
