<p>If a pipeline in your home has dripped for months and gone without repairs, mold can grow as an outcome, however it won't be covered by your homeowners insurance coverage.

<p>The location that is being treated is sealed, as mold spores can easily travel once they are disrupted. Air filtration systems are typically utilized in combination with the sealing of the area to get rid of as numerous airborne spores as possible and to avoid spread. Sealing the location involves using both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, along with unfavorable air pressure, which prevents the blood circulation of air between the infected space and the areas around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the location will be switched off to prevent the mold from spreading also.</p>
<p>Make certain to keep pictures of the water damage and all documents associated with the damage and your claim in the event mold grows in the future. Your insurance company might be hesitant to agree that any prospective mold is the result of prior water damage, however having photos and records will work as valuable proof of your claim. If the mold is considered to have come from water damage, some insurance companies might make you submit a second claim of water damage instead, requiring you to pay another deductible before remediation happens.</p>
