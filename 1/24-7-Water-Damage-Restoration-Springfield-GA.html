<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Looking after water damage needs to be done in a timely fashion. If it sits for too long, there's a possibility that more damage will occur or a Classification 1 water damage will develop into a Category 2, which can have impacts on your health.

Water damage can deteriorate the stability of specific structural materials, making them a risk if they collapse. Sometimes, this product might not be able to dry appropriately, so to avoid water staying caught in the location, it will be removed.</p>
