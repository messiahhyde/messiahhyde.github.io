Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out just how much water costs I was paying since the leakage started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the place of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve.
