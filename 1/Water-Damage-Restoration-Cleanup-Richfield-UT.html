This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this rust procedure is not stopped, you will likely end up with an extremely expensive paperweight.</p>
