<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air until they land somewhere. Think of planting seeds in the ground.

Mold works the same way, so if the place the spores land is moist and great, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
<p>An insurance policy may or may not cover the costs associated with water damage and the process of water damage restoration. While a common cause of residential water damage is typically the failure of a sump pump, numerous house owner's insurance plan do not cover the associated costs without an addendum which contributes to the monthly premium of the policy.
