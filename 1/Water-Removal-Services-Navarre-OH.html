<p>Mold is a fungi that can be discovered both indoors and outdoors. Nobody understands the number of types of mold exist but estimates variety from tens of thousands to perhaps 3 hundred thousand or more. Mold spreads and recreates by making spores. Spores can survive conditions that are too bright, hot, cold, damp or dry for mold to grow. They can be brought by air or water to new areas when spores are released.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we equip the property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for every 2 to 3 rooms, depending upon the size of the room. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it goes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which implies that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can think of, throughout numerous days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
