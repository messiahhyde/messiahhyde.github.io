<p>Flooding of a personal sewage system can be a harmful circumstance for property owners, according to Plumbing 2.0's veteran pipes experts in Mesa, Arizona It may lead to a back-up of sewage in the home, polluted drinking water and lack of sanitation till the system is fixed. When flooding or saturated soil conditions persist, a private sewage system can not operate correctly (common pipes problems in old houses ).
