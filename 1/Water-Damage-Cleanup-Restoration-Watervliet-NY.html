<p>As wetness is released in the air, nature constantly tries to reach balance. Calculating the humidity is necessary in drying due to the fact that when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The dew point always takes place at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature the air needs to be cooled to, at consistent pressure, in order to achieve an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas form. If the air were to be cooled much more, water vapor would need to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid type. The greater the humidity increases, the higher the quantity of wetness in the air.</p>

Leakages from the roof will make this area damp, which in turn leads 2 to greater than typical mold growth.

<p>Recent Evaluation: We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were very pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot performed in one day!  Someone has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to finish the job appropriately. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
