<h3>From Fire Water Restoration to Mold Removal in Shelton</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repairs. By decreasing the thickness here, it's easier to conceal long taped seams under numerous coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it is essential to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the job is completed.<p>
