<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Measure the height and width of the area you're repairing so that you understand how much brand-new wallboard you need. If you require custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, utilize your measurements to cut a patch to fit, using an energy knife or drywall saw. Align your new panel with the wall studs and after that protect the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power chauffeur. Use joint tape to cover the joints where each panel meets. Then use joint substance over the tape, utilizing a putty knife. Let the compound dry for the time specified by the maker and then sand the compound with fine-grit sandpaper until the seams are flush with the drywall panels.</p>

<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and hauled away everything else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got a lot performed in one day!  Someone has come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job appropriately. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
