<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, however when he discovered just how much water bill I was paying since the leak started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & found of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve. Easy-going and very courteous person.</p>
