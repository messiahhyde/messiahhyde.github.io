Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
