<p>To keep indoor surfaces as dry as possible, attempt to keep the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the remainder of the year. You can purchase devices to measure relative humidity at some home supply stores. Ventilation, air blood circulation near cold surface areas, dehumidification, and efforts to decrease the production of wetness in the home are all very important in managing high humidity that often causes mold development in our environment.</p>
<h3>Water Leak Cleanup in Romeoville Illinois</h2>
<p>If the weather permits, open doors and windows to eliminate moisture and odors. If the outside humidity becomes higher than inside, close things up; similarly, close up your home over night if temperature levels drop and wet air may otherwise be drawn inside.
