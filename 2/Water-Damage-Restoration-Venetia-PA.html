<h3>From Fire Water Restoration to Mold Removal in Venetia</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, plaster and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a long-term health danger and should be eliminated if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
<p>This class includes water losses impacting an entire room of carpet and cushion. Water has wicked less than 24 inches up walls. There is moisture staying in structural products (e.g., plywood, particle board, structural wood, VCT, concrete, etc.). To remove surface mildew on floorings and woodwork, utilize a phosphate cleaning service such as powdered automatic dishwashing cleaning agent or trisodium phosphate (4 to 6 tablespoons to a gallon of water), available in hardware stores. Wash with water, and when dry, apply a mildew-resistant finish.<p>
