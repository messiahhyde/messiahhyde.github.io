<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the current rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, but when he learnt how much water expense I was paying because the leak began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & discovered of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Extremely respectful and easy-going individual.</p>
