<p>Whether it happens in your ceiling because of a dripping roof, condensation from your central air conditioning, or flooding, repairing water-damaged drywall can cause you anxiety and irritation, especially if you've never done it before. Mold requires simply three things to endure and grow: darkness, moisture and humidity. The most typical locations in your home for mold development are basements, showers, around heating and cooling appliances, ducts, carpets and crawlspaces. The very best way to prevent mold growth is to get rid of water leakages or moisture in your home. See our article, How Do I Avoid Mold Growth?" for mold avoidance tips.</p>
<p>Daily moisture readings must be included in the drying record to include equipment, air, and a/c systems. Wetness material levels for wet structural products need to be recorded in a moisture material spreadsheet to reveal the development of drying These tape-recorded wetness content readings will reveal that the building is back to an acceptable range of pre-loss condition. It is essential to understand that air records alone will not prove that a structure is dry. After 24 hr the psychrometric conditions will show if enough dehumidification is being utilized or if changes are needed.</p>
