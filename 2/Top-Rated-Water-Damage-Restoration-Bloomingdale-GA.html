<h3>Fire Damage Contractors in Bloomingdale</h3>
<p>Eliminate plaster, wallboard and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be an irreversible health hazard and should be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
