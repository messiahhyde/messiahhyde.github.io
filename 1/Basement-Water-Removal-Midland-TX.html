<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely damaging. Jake and his people were amazing in helping us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your home and began drying out our drenched crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (often twice a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and also were really practical in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd suggest them without doubt.</p>
