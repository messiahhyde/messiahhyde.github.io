<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to assess which drying devices or methods will be the most reliable. It is crucial to determine if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in determining what devices to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, latent and reasonable energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula precisely anticipates the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to several building products and how they respond to each one and supply the best evaporation results. The greater the number, the faster materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more useful if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
