They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot done in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job effectively.
