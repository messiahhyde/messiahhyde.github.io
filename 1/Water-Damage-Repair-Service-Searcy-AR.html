Part of our monitoring process includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature level too, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days.
