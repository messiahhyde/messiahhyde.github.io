<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken.

Additionally, they're completely non-toxic. You can buy tea tree oil online and in health shops; just make sure that its from melaleuca alternifolia (an Australian tree) and that its active ingredients consist of 30 percent terpinen 4-ol and no greater than 10 to 15 percent cineole.
