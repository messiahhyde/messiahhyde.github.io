<p>I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the water company informed me if it's addressing the current rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he learnt how much water costs I was paying given that the leak started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the area & found of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve. Very polite and easy-going individual.<p>
