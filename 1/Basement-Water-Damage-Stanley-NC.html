<h3>Fire Damage Clean Up in Stanley</h3>
<p>Get rid of wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a long-term health danger and need to be removed if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
