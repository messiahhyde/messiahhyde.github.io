<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to evaluate which drying equipment or methods will be the most reliable.

These conditions can help in determining what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, practical and hidden energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately forecasts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to numerous building materials and how they respond to each one and supply the best evaporation outcomes.
