<p>Next use the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to wipe the soot and smoke discolorations. This phase is vital, as these sponges use unique chemicals to lift discolorations from walls. Never ever utilize soot cleaner or water before you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you might spread out the soot and make it difficult to remove with a chemical sponge. Begin cleaning the walls carefully with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're constantly utilizing a clean surface area. When all sides are stained, trim the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surfaces beneath. Or simply grab a new sponge. Make sure you use a cleaning motion the whole time.
