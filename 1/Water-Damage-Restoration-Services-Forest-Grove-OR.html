<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Often it will be obvious that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might reveal noticeable indications of wetness, leaking water, or indications of failing structural integrity.

Other times, you may see little signs like coffee-colored stains that may expand in time.</p>
<p>Class 4 - deeply held or bound water. Water invasion that involves a substantial quantity of water absorption into low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floorings, or other complex, built up assemblies). Drying might require special approaches, longer drying times, or substantial water vapor pressure differentials.</p>
