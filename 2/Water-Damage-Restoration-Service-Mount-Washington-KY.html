<h2>Tips For Effective Water Damage Restoration in Mount Washington</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inadequate versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
