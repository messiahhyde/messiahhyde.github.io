Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
