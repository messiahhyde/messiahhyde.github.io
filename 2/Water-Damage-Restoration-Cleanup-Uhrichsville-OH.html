<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier since it is self-adhesive, numerous professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't constantly practical. Using paper tape needs some practice and little skill, but it's well worth discovering.
