<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many people think that due to the fact that smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this implies that the smoke will spread, harming a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include searching a large area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
