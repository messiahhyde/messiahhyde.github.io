<h3>The Basics of Fire Damage Restoration in Manhattan</h3>
<p>Protect Non-Damaged Areas- As soon as containment barriers are set up we will start getting rid of the wet dry wall and start to dry inside the walls. If there is damaged carpet, we will pull the pad that is under the carpet, which allows the carpet to dry. We will also move furniture out of the wet locations to guarantee that all excess moisture inside a wall or under a floor is dried, so no mold issues occur later.<p>
<p>When it concerns water damage, there isn't anything we haven't seen. Whether you had a leaky roofing system turn your ceiling into drywall pudding or you have actually had 6 inches of water flooding your home, we've effectively repaired thousands of houses with water damage over the past twenty years. Containment- A 1" X 1" location of mold develops millions of spores that are launched into the air during the cleaning process, which can be very harmful to the health of everyone in the home. Just Water Damage Companies that use what's called a Negative Air System to include the contaminated air have the ability to avoid health issues.<p>
