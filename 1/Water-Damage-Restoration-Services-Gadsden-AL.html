<p>Due to the fact that typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness direct exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
