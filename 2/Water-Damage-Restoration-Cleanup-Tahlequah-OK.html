<h3>Smoke Clean Up Service in Tahlequah</h3>
<p>When you are planning big repairs, keep in mind that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By lowering the density here, it's simpler to hide long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is necessary to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the job is completed.<p>
