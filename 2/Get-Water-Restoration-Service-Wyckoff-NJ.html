Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he found out how much water costs I was paying considering that the leak started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the place of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve.
