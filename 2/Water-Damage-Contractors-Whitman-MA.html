Toll's vice president of construction, Anthony Geonnotti, for example, testified in 2017 that, within somewhat more than two years, he had examined 300 to 350 homes in the area for water invasion-- with roughly 85 percent needing repair work, according to an arbitration hearing transcript submitted in court.
