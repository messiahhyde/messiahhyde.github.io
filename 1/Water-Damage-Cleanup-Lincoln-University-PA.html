<p>Mold requires nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperature levels to grow. Nutrients for mold exist in dead organic product such as wood, paper or materials; mold can likewise obtain nutrients from some synthetic items such as paints and adhesives. Mold needs moisture, although some mold species can acquire that moisture from wet air when the relative humidity is above 70 per cent. Thoroughly pry baseboards far from walls so that you can inspect sheetrock at floor level.
