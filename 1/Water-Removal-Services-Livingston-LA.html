<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people think that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this indicates that the smoke will spread, damaging a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will involve searching a large area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
