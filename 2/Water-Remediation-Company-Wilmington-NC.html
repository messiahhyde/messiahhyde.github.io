<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one jet stream. The rotor brings the wet desiccant to the reactivation air stream to heat it up. When wet incoming air flows over a wheel filled with a silica gel desiccant, desiccant dehumidifiers work.

<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the property with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one system for every single 2 to 3 spaces, depending on the size of the room.

These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which means that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This procedure goes on for days.
