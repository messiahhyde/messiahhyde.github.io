<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the property with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for each two to three spaces, depending on the size of the room. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it travels through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which suggests that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of numerous days, the air that is available in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
