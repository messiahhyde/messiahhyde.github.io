<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to examine which drying devices or methods will be the most reliable. It is important to figure out if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based on the outdoors temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can assist in determining what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, sensible and latent energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula precisely predicts the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure materials and how they react to each one and provide the very best evaporation results. The higher the number, the much faster materials will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more useful if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
