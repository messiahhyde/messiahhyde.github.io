<h2>Water Damage Restoration - What Are Your Options in East Longmeadow</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Mold can trigger severe health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Crawl areas typically grow mold for the same reasons as basements do-they tend to stay moist long-lasting. They're smaller sized than basements, however, and usually have more ventilation, so they don't tend to have as big a mold growth location, making typical expenses closer to $500 for remediation. Since of the size and ventilation, cleanup in this area is normally less extreme, so cleaning and eliminating affected locations is often enough.</p>
