<h3>Fire Damage Cleaning Services in Bellevue</h3>
<p>These are typically good signs of mold, possibly hazardous and definitely something you want to remove. The taxonomic name for the greenish-black mold that shows up on carpet, wallpaper, and ceiling tiles is Stachybotrys Chartarum or Black Mold.

If there is a great deal of mold development, consult the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's assistance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ".  versions of these and other guidance files are readily available on the EPA's Publications on Mold website If the moldy product is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement may be needed.<p>
