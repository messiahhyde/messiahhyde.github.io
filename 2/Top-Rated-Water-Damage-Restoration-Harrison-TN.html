<p>Mold in the basement can be relentless, offered the nature of basements - they tend to be a lot more damp than above-ground levels and generally have bad ventilation and little air flow, a mix that can trigger mold to thrive. And of course, basements can be susceptible to flooding, due to severe weather condition or undiscovered leaks in the pipelines or sump pump. In addition, as soon as mold establishes, cinder block or concrete walls can be challenging to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
<p>As soon as standing water is removed, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually absorbed (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outside air can likewise set a drying task back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any changes if you have questions on this.</p>

Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, however when he learnt just how much water costs I was paying since the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the location & found of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Extremely respectful and easy-going individual.</p>
