<p>As soon as standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) remove the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure includes inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily depending on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any changes.</p>
<p>More involved testing might involve sending samples to a screening facility, or taking samples of the air to evaluate if there is no noticeable mold, but mold is suspected. Checking for mold may cost as little as $20 for a home kit or as much as $500 for professional testing. Keep in mind, however, that it is typically baseless, as most remediation services will continue the same way regardless of what kind of mold is found in your house.</p>
