<p>The first step to fixing water damage in your home is to recognize the source of the water. In many cases, like damaged pipes or natural disaster, the source will be easily recognizable.

Bales Restoration was ready when we got the emergency water-damage call for this flooded office complex.

<p>A bleach option also works to kill mold. Mix one cup of bleach in a gallon of water, apply to the surface area and don't rinse. As household home appliances grow older, their pipes may begin to crack and rust and their connections or tubes can compromise as the materials age. Refrigerators, hot water heater, washing makers and dishwaters are all have many parts that are vulnerable to wear and tear, so keep a mindful watch on older models. The two greatest culprits for water damage in homes are washing machines and warm water tanks.<p>
