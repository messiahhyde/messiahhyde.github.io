<p>You wish to address restroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and develops a best breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the road to flooded restroom healing. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to raise and unsettle the dampened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
