<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken.

Other times, you may see little signs like coffee-colored stains that may expand in time.</p>

Water invasion that involves a substantial quantity of water absorption into low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floorings, or other complex, built up assemblies). Drying might require special approaches, longer drying times, or substantial water vapor pressure differentials.</p>
