<p>The MDH does not provide inspection or testing services. MDH supplies technical advice by phone and email, and recommends people to investigate potential mold problems on their own first. Homeowners can work with indoor air quality service providers to assist them in investigating and remediating mold. These professionals might have tools such as moisture meters, scoping electronic cameras and infrared cameras that might work in an examination. There are also mold remediation professionals that specialize in cleaning and getting rid of mold. Neither the state of Minnesota nor any federal agency licenses or licenses mold private investigators or remediators.</p>
<p>Some air cleaners are designed to produce ozone which is a strong oxidizing representative and a known irritant of the lungs and respiratory system. Studies have actually revealed that ozone, even at high concentrations, is ineffective at eliminating air-borne mold or surface area mold contamination. Even if mold was killed by ozone, the health hazards would not be lowered until mold impurities are gotten rid of through cleaning. Health experts, including the Minnesota Department of Health, do not suggest the use of ozone to attend to mold or any other indoor air issues.</p>
