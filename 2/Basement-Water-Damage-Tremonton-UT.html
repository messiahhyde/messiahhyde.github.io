<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>
