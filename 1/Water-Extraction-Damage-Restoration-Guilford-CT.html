<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Before your house has actually dried, scrub floorings and woodwork with a stiff brush, a lot of water, a detergent and disinfectant. Carpeting soaked by polluted floodwater must be eliminated and discarded unless it can be sterilized at a commercial facility for a cost substantially less than replacement. Vinyl flooring and floor tile might need to be eliminated to enable drying of subfloor.</p>
