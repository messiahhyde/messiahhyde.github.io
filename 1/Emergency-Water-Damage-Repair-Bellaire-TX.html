<p>Remediation experts must reveal, in writing, when and how they are differing the ANSI requirement. This consists of if they do both testing and remediation, as that is considered a dispute of interest. We encourage that the conditions be evaluated pre- and post-remediation by an independent certified professional and that a separate certified remediation company perform the work. When not possible, the reason why must be mentioned (e.g. remote areas might not have both).<p>
<p>Also, because bleach is mainly water, on permeable surface areas, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is easily taken in by the product. So, while you might have wiped off or discolored the surface mold to the point that you can't see it, you've actually offered a lot of water to regrow and potentially spread the mold beneath the surface area. If there is a great deal of mold growth, seek advice from the U.S. Epa's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ".  variations of these and other guidance files are readily available on the EPA's Publications on Mold website If the moldy product is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement may be required.<p>
