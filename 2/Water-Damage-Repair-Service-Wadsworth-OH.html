<p>Whether it happens in your ceiling because of a leaking roofing, condensation from your central air, or flooding, fixing water-damaged drywall can trigger you anxiety and stress, especially if you have actually never done it before. Mold requires just 3 things to grow and endure: moisture, darkness and humidity. The most typical locations in your house for mold development are basements, showers, around heating and cooling devices, carpets, crawlspaces and ducts. The best way to prevent mold development is to eliminate water leaks or wetness in your home. See our post, How Do I Prevent Mold Development?" for mold avoidance pointers.</p>

Once dry-out is complete, our approach to fire damage cleanup and smoke damage removal starts with state of the art ventilation innovation to clean out your home and eliminate particles drifting in the air. We then start the process of cleaning walls, floorings, ceilings, carpet, and upholstery that isn't beyond being restored.

We don't desire spores to get away during the process and potentially enter into other parts of the home or structure where they can grow once again.</p>
