<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, but it can occur by itself if a fire is contained. A number of hundred suits filed in the last 5 years allege that the majority of these homes contain lots of infractions of the state-mandated building code that ultimately allowed water to drain pipes into both new and refurbished houses. Many homes with water damage absence standard weatherproofing materials, assessment reports say. Coats of stucco are typically too thin. According to a suit by the owners of a $1.96 million Center City townhouse, craftsmanship was so bad that, even before the household moved in, a mushroom grew in the floorboard of their 20-month-old child's bed room.</p>
<p>Many people are anxious to eliminate mold after they find it due to the fact that it is a health hazard.
