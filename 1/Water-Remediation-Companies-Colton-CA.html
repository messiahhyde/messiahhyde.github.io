<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying given that the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & found of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and extremely courteous person.</p>
