<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>The most successful water damage restoration tasks start with a comprehensive extraction; our exclusive extraction devices will begin things off on the best foot. We will then offer you with a drying strategy and the proper equipment to complete the procedure. We invest greatly in the most up-to-date drying equipment to manage the drying process. Advanced evaluation tools will verify the drying procedure and even assist in finding any hidden pockets of water.</p>

All heating, cooling, and fans in the area will be shut off to avoid the mold from spreading as well.</p>
