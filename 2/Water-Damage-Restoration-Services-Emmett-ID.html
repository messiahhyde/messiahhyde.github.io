<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely harmful. We engaged a group of scientists at the University of Colorado once InstaScope was developed. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a globally recognized specialist on the biological elements of air contamination, this group was appointed to validate and evaluate the new innovation.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
