<p>As moisture is released in the air, nature always attempts to reach stability. Determining the dew point is very important in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surfaces. The dew point always occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature level the air needs to be cooled to, at consistent pressure, in order to achieve an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas form. If the air were to be cooled a lot more, water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid kind. The greater the dew point rises, the greater the amount of moisture in the air.</p>
