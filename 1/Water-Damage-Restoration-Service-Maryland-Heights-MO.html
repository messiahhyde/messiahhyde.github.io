<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be incredibly devastating. Jake and his people were amazing in helping us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to your house and started drying our drenched crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (often twice a day) to monitor and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and likewise were very valuable in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd advise them without doubt.</p>
<p>They called me morning and asked me for assistance. I got here to access the scenario and found the water was running through the floor to the downstairs ceilings and all the drywall was damaged. To contribute to the issue, we had insulated all the floorings and interior walls for sound absorption. All had to be gotten rid of and reinstalled throughout the home. We also set up portable heating fans to accelerate the drying process.</p>
