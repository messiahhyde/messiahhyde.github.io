The best smoke damage restoration approaches will include searching a broad area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

Since borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to wash it off. However, do not utilize this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall. Such materials take in water easily. This could worsen the problem because as you understand - mold enjoys damp environments.<p>

<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and hauled away everything else.  We were very delighted that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to do the job correctly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
