<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air till they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same way, so if the place the spores land is great and wet, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Daily moisture readings need to be included in the drying record to include equipment, heating and cooling, and air systems. Wetness material levels for damp structural products must be taped in a moisture content spreadsheet to show the progress of drying These tape-recorded moisture material readings will reveal that the structure is back to an appropriate variety of pre-loss condition. It is very important to understand that air records alone will not prove that a structure is dry. After 24 hr the psychrometric conditions will show if enough dehumidification is being utilized or if changes are needed.</p>
