<h3>Smoke Damage Restoration in Sanford</h3>
<p>I experienced water damage in my home, from the upstairs ceiling down the walls. I found First Response online, and they were out within the hour. It was an extreme experience, but whatever they did for me was great. They best feature of First Response was that they had the ability to handle my insurance company when they were offering me issues. This most likely helped me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and dealt with the issue for me, which was a big relief. They were really professional, and I liked everyone I handled from the company. They covered all the bases, and the repairs were dealt with to my satisfaction. I would utilize them again.<p>
