<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, many expert drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I prefer paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't constantly practical. Using paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, however it's well worth finding out. Once the meters check out moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the service technician will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the area.
