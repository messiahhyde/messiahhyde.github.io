<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repairs. By minimizing the thickness here, it's simpler to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is very important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is completed, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
