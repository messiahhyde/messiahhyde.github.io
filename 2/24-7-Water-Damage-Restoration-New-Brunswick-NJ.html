<h3>Why You Should Hire New Brunswick Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>When you are planning large repairs, keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By minimizing the density here, it's much easier to conceal long taped seams under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it is very important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is ended up.<p>
