<h3>Fire Restoration Experts in Hickory</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health risk and should be removed if soaked by polluted floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the idea of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
