<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health hazard and ought to be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
