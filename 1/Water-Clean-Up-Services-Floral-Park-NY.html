There are over 100,000 types of types of mold, but the most common types of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore lands on a food source that is wet and warm, it begins to colonize and sprout within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots start to turn into the food source and mycotoxins or harmful gasses are released as the fungis spreads. Mold in your house can be exceptionally unsafe and result in a variety of health issues. If the mold in your house is not removed properly it can continue to grow, making efficient mold remediation more difficult and expensive.<p>
