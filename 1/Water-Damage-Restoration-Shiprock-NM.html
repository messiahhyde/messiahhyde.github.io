Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, but when he found out just how much water costs I was paying because the leakage started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the location of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve.
