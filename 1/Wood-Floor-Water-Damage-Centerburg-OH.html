<p>There are three standard steps to the water damage restoration process. The primary step is to remove all of the water from the impacted property. That indicates fixing any plumbing issues, fixing any issues that could be causing condensation, or waiting on the floodwaters to recede, depending on the situations. After the issue has actually been fixed, the residential or commercial property then needs to be thoroughly dried out, removing all traces of wetness.</p>
<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one jet stream. The rotor brings the wet desiccant to the reactivation air stream to heat it up. When wet incoming air streams over a wheel filled with a silica gel desiccant, desiccant dehumidifiers work. This process absorbs wetness without ice build-up and is not limited by low temperatures. Desiccants can easily operate listed below freezing temperatures.</p>
