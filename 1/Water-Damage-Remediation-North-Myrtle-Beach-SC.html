<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
