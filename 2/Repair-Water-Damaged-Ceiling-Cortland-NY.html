A fireplace can provide your living room a sense of warmth and convenience even when there's no fire, however a weathered and cracked chimney can frequently let in rain during the cooler months which can leak through the walls. In time, wetness from the water can cause the paint on the wall to bubble, flake and peel. Water damage can turn your cosy little living room into a worn out and unloved space.<p>
