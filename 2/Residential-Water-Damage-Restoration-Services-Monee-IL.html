<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Class 4 - deeply held or bound water. Water intrusion that includes a significant amount of water absorption into low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, fitness center floors, or other complex, developed assemblies). Drying may need special techniques, longer drying times, or considerable water vapor pressure differentials.</p>

<p>Under the law, it is your right to identify what company will perform work in your home or business.
