<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. An automatic shut-off valve is exceptional insurance coverage to have in any situation, specifically when the water heater unit is located inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your hot water heater is imminent unless repaired rapidly, and the expenses increase the longer the issue goes uncorrected.

<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was basic: It was an ideal storm"-- a mix that attorneys now allege originated from pressure to build quicker, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building products, and little federal government and contractor oversight. Add to that a climate like Pennsylvania's, where the average annual rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the capacity for water damage was that much greater.</p>
