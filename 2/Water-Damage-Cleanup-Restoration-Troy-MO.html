Utilizing customized equipment, water mitigation contractors and their teams can draw out water from many surfaces and spaces of your home. Vacuum systems can pull water up through your carpeting and the cushioning that lies beneath, pump water out of your basement and drain standing puddles from around home furnishings, components and cabinets.

We will also examine vapor barriers (a sheet or coating that prevents water vapor from penetrating walls) and eliminate them if they have been damaged.</p>
