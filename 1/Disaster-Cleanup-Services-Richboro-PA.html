They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.
