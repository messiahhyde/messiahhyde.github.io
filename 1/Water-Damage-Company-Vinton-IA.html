<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals believe that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this implies that the smoke will spread, harming a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a broad area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
