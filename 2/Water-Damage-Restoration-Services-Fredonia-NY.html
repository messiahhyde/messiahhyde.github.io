<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away whatever else.  We were very happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to finish the job effectively. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
