Warm air in between about 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal, particularly for the first 36 to 48 hours of drying and is the optimum temperature level for the operation of low grain dehumidifiers. Cooler air slows evaporation, so being warmer than 70 degrees Fahrenheit aids in the evaporation process. Overly hot air above 90 degrees Fahrenheit hinders the dehumidifiers' efficiency.<p>
