<h3>Professional Fire Restoration in Culver City</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, paneling and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health threat and should be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the idea of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
