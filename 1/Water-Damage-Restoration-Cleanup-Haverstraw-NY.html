<p>Mold can trigger serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Class 4 - deeply held or bound water. Water intrusion that involves a significant amount of water absorption into low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floors, or other complex, built up assemblies). Drying might require unique approaches, longer drying times, or considerable water vapor pressure differentials.</p>
