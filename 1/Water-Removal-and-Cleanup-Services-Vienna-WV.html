<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air up until they land someplace. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same way, so if the place the spores land is damp and great, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores.

Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
