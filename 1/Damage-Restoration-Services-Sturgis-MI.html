Lots of people swear by raw rice, encouraging owners to put their moist iPad or iPhone in a huge bowl of the stuff (cover it entirely) and leave it there for 48 hours approximately. A: Mold is a tiny fungi that belongs to the natural environment and needed for our environment. While it is necessary in the outside world, excessive mold inside a structure can be unhygienic and unsafe. Mold produces spores as part of its lifecycle, and these spores drift through the air both inside and outside.<p>
<p>Don't presume your house owners insurance will pay to repair your mold issues.

If you experience water damage, it is necessary NOT to take a knee jerk reaction. It's best to call your insurer instantly. Choosing the restoration company is completely decided by the home owner.<p>
