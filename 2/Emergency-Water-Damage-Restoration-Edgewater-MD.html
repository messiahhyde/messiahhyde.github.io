Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, but when he discovered how much water costs I was paying since the leakage began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & discovered of the leak for me and then even assisted me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely courteous individual.</p>
