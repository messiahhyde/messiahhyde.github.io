Likewise remember that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is finished, this assists strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
