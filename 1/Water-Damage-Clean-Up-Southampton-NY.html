<p>Eliminate plaster, paneling and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health risk and should be gotten rid of if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the idea of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
