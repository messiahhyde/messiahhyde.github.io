<h3>Fire Restoration Cleaning in Greenwood</h3>
<p>Eliminate plaster, wallboard and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a permanent health risk and must be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the idea of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
<p>Major storms and flooding events can overwhelm many restoration companies. On the other hand, SERVPRO of North Orange County and SERVPRO of South Orange County can access resources from 1,700 Franchises across the state and nation and even utilize Disaster Healing Teams for significant storms and disasters.
