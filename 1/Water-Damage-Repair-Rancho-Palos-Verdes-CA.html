<p>First things first - prepare what you require Basically, you need a trustworthy product in cleaning mold. Lots of home owners think that bleach is an effective mold treatment. But contrary to the popular view, it isn't. Bleach is a strong chemical which can damage your health. Also, it does not eliminate the mold. It just alters its color from black to white or grey. After a few weeks of bleaching, there is still a big possibility that the mold will return.</p>
