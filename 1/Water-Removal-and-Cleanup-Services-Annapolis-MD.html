<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your house or service is one of the most devastating things that can happen to a person or a family. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be repaired rather than being fully replaced. If there is small damage then most of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard might require fixing. Nevertheless, if the damage is significant then the entire floor might require replacing and in some cases even the subfloor too.

Solid hardwood flooring allows for a wider variety of alternatives to repair the issue. With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface area.
