They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were really delighted that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job effectively.
