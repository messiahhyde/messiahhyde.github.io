The very best way to prevent mold growth is to remove water leakages or wetness in your house. See our post, How Do I Prevent Mold Growth?" for mold prevention ideas.</p>

<p>Fire is the outcome of a chemical reaction between the oxygen that exists in the atmosphere and a source of flammable fuel. Once this flammable fuel - furniture, carpet, or drywall - has been warmed to its unique ignition temperature, the fuel will ignite and unstable gases will be released in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can trigger lasting damage and should be handled by knowledgeable specialists, heat is the most visible, and devastating, product of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - implying that as a fire enters contact with extra fuel, the response continues and the fire spreads.</p>
