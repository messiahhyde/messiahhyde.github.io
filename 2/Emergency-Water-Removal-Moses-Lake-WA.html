<p>Getting it damp can turn into a significant headache since the gypsum drywall is soluble and permeable in water. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the event where drywall does get damp and simply begins to sag before drying, fixing it might simply require pushing it back into location, securing it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

<p>Fire is the outcome of a chemical reaction between the oxygen that is present in the atmosphere and a source of flammable fuel. Once this combustible fuel - drywall, furniture, or carpet - has been warmed to its distinct ignition temperature level, the fuel will ignite and volatile gases will be released in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can trigger enduring damage and must be handled by experienced experts, heat is the most visible, and destructive, product of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - suggesting that as a fire comes into contact with extra fuel, the reaction continues and the fire spreads.</p>
<p>This location of the attic is one of the most often impacted areas, which is why it's often treated independently. Leaks from the roofing will make this area damp, which in turn leads 2 to higher than typical mold development. Cleaning the underside of the deck completely and using scrubbers to ensure the spores don't spread out is the common process here, and expenses around $500.</p>
