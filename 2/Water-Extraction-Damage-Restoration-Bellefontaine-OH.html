Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, an internationally acknowledged specialist on the biological elements of air pollution, this group was appointed to verify and evaluate the brand-new technology. Needless to state, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to develop a brand-new mold-assessment system for commercial consumers that, unlike any other approach or gadget, can provide clinically precise, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so immediately. So when you consider all the threats of mold, InstaScope is a vital tool to help ensure the health of your home and the health of your family.</p>
