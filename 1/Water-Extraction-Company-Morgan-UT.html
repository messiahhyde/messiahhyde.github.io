Wear a respirator or a facemask rated for black mold spore defense, and cover arms, hands and legs to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to remove noticeable mold.

Next, use commercial black mold removal items, which can be discovered in many hardware or home repair shops, to disinfect the moldy areas, in addition to any nearby areas. Make sure it won't discolor the material or surface if you utilize bleach. Place all sponges, equipment and other products utilized in cleaning in a heavy duty trash can, and if possible, eliminate the bag through a nearby exit instead of the main house, to prevent distributing mold spores.</p>
