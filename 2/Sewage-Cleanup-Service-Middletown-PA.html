<p>Remove it; take the SIM card out too if the damp iPhone is in a case. (Getting rid of the battery would not injure either, however just if you're confident about the technicalities and don't mind voiding the service warranty.) These actions help to lower the number of crannies and nooks where water can remain, and avoid damage to parts. Next, scrub the area to remove all of the mold and mold discolorations. And lastly, clean the surface area down to eliminate residual mold and spores.<p>
<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier because it is self-adhesive, lots of expert drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I prefer paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't constantly practical. Using paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, however it's well worth learning. As soon as the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the technician will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this moment, the water remediation procedure is considered to complete.<p>
<p>If you're dealing with a smaller sized hole (as much as 6"), use a thin layer of joint substance around the hole. Put your patch into the hole. Using a putty knife, work the paper edge down into the compound. Feather the edges of the compound and permit it to dry. Sand gently with a fine-grit sandpaper and apply a 2nd layer of joint substance to finish the repair. As water and storm damage specialists, we have the experience and advanced training that enables us to restore your home quickly. We utilize clinical drying concepts and offer recognition and documents that your residential or commercial property is dry and the task is total.<p>
