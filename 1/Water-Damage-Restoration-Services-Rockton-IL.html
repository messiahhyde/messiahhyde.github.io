<p>The most crucial element of fixing drywall water damage is to prevent extra damage from mold or mildew. When moist drywall sits with inadequate ventilation, mold and mildew occur most often. Despite the area or degree of the damage, we recommend using dehumidifiers, commercial fans, or comparable makers that can move a large volume of air for maximum ventilation. Basic family fans are not efficient in moving an appropriate amount of air required to dry a room properly.</p>
