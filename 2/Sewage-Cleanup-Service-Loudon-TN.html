<p>As soon as standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually absorbed (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) remove the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure consists of examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any adjustments.</p>
<p>A last inspection assists discover any possible location where mold may still prowl. Surfaces with contamination and mold are removed and destroyed and the work area is tidied up.
