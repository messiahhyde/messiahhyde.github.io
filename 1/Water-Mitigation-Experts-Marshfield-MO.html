Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne.
