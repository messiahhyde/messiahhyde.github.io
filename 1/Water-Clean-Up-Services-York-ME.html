Part of our monitoring process includes examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying project back days.
