Toll's vice president of building, Anthony Geonnotti, for instance, testified in 2017 that, within a little more than two years, he had examined 300 to 350 homes in the area for water invasion-- with approximately 85 percent requiring repairs, according to an arbitration hearing transcript submitted in court.
