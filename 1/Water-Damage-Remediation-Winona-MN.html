<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier since it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I prefer paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't always hassle-free. Using paper tape requires some practice and little skill, but it's well worth discovering. As soon as the meters read wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the service technician will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this point, the water remediation process is considered to finish.<p>
