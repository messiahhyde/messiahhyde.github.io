As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to change the damage with complete sheets.

While a lot of agents can fight mold (Borax, vinegar, ammonia, and bleach, to name a few), tea tree oil and grapefruit seed extract are often considered the most reliable items to decontaminate and ventilate the problem location. Moreover, they're totally non-toxic. You can purchase tea tree oil online and in health stores; just guarantee that its from melaleuca alternifolia (an Australian tree) which its active components consist of 30 percent terpinen 4-ol and no greater than 10 to 15 percent cineole.
