<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inadequate versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

We typically will set one system for every single two to three rooms, depending on the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it goes through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor removed. This procedure goes on for days. As you can picture, throughout a number of days, the air that comes in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
