<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Mold remediation ought to not just kill an existing growth, but also ensure mold doesn't discover a way to come back.
