<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be incredibly destructive. Jake and his guys were fantastic in assisting us make it through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They fasted to get to the house and began drying our drenched crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (typically two times a day) to keep track of and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the way and also were really helpful in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster.
