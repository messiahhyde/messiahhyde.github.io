<p>We just recently had major water damage due to a washing maker overflow. Rainbow came out to your home on a Sunday night over a three-day weekend and proceeded to take the action necessary to avoid additional damage working late into the night. They also completed the entire dry out which took numerous days and a great deal of hard work. Always gotten here on time and did what they promised and kept me notified of each action.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the water company informed me if it's going at the present rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying considering that the leak began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & discovered of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Very respectful and easy-going individual.</p>
