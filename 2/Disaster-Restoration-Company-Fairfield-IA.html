<p>When standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) remove the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air.
