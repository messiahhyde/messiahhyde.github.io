To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the solution on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush up until the mold vanishes. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to rinse it off. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such products take in water easily.
