<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the water company informed me if it's addressing the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he learnt just how much water costs I was paying given that the leakage started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & discovered of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and very respectful individual.</p>
