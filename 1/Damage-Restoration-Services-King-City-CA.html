<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Step the height and width of the space you're fixing so that you know how much new wallboard you require. If you need custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, utilize your measurements to cut a spot to fit, using an energy knife or drywall saw. Align your brand-new panel with the wall studs and then protect the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power chauffeur. Use joint tape to cover the seams where each panel fulfills. Then use joint substance over the tape, using a putty knife.

<p>When you're eliminating the damaged location, it's a good idea to cut it out as a rectangle or square While this usually increases the amount of area you need to replace, this makes it easier to cut and fit patches.

Anything bigger should be connected to the ceiling joists in order to securely hold the patch's weight as well as any insulation above it.</p>
