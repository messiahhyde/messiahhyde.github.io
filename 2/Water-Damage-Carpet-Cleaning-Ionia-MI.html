<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Even as contractors have actually combated claims, almost two dozen house owners stated that they were never informed of any prospective problem-- even as some building executives understood of its degree. Toll's vice president of building and construction, Anthony Geonnotti, for instance, affirmed in 2017 that, within somewhat more than 2 years, he had examined 300 to 350 homes in the region for water intrusion-- with approximately 85 percent needing repair work, according to an arbitration hearing records submitted in court.
