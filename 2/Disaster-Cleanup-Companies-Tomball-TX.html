<p>Fire is the result of a chain reaction between the oxygen that is present in the atmosphere and a source of combustible fuel. Once this combustible fuel - carpet, drywall, or furniture - has actually been heated to its distinct ignition temperature, the fuel will ignite and unstable gases will be launched in the form of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can cause long lasting damage and must be handled by knowledgeable experts, heat is the most noticeable, and harmful, product of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - suggesting that as a fire enters contact with additional fuel, the response continues and the fire spreads.</p>
<p>Rust is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the gradual and slow wear and tear of products (normally metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion takes place when you combine electricity, water, metal and oxygen, developing iron oxide (or what is more typically called rust). There is no reputable timetable for this procedure to occur; a MacBook's internal components usually start rusting right away after the spill, but sometimes your Mac can work usually for days or weeks without revealing any obvious indication of an issue. How quick the corrosion process takes depends on a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and how long the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all till you can resolve the damage. Below are a few examples of corrosion caused by a water spill.</p>
