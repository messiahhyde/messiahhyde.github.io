<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many people believe that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion happens, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this suggests that the smoke will spread, harming a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration techniques will include browsing a broad area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
