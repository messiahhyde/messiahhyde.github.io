<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does.

And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve searching a large area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
