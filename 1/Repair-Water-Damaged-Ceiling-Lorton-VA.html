<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Often it will be apparent that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might show visible indications of moisture, dripping water, or signs of stopping working structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might droop or crumble under the weight of water that fills the naturally permeable plaster product. Other times, you might see small signs like coffee-colored spots that might broaden in time.</p>
<p>Mold growths (colonies) can develop within 24-48 hours, so it is necessary to act instantly if you have a water spill or leakage-- specifically if you live in a humid or hot environment.
