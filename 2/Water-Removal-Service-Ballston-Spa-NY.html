<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we equip the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers.

The existing air is drawn through the intake where it goes through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and certified to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which indicates that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor eliminated. This procedure goes on for days.
