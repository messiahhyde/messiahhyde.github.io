<h2>Water Damage Repair and Restoration Tips in North Dartmouth</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
