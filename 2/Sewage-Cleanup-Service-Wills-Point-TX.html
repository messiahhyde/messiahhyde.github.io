<p>Since common building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

Condensation in the location in between the attic and your home can trigger wetness on the underside of the roofing system, which can lead to mold and decaying. When examining your home for possible causes of water damage make sure to keep an eye out for wetness in lighting fixtures in addition to the general condition of any visible piping.</p>
